Snackbox is a supplier of fresh fruit and snack boxes ([www.snackbox.lt](https://www.dailylunch.lt)) with office in Vilnius, Lithuania. Snackbox operates in the business-to-business segment in Lithuania and is exploring a new concept using intelligent fridges to provide fresh food in business centers and private areas of Snackbox customers. The intelligent fridges work like traditional vending machines, but make it possible to supply fresh foods e.g. fruit, salads, dairy products and give a more home-like experience to the consumers.

This new concept makes use of commercial fridges from third party suppliers which include an electronic lock which can be opened by an App. The consumers need a personal Account to have access to the App and to be able to identify and open the Fridge.

The consumers provide their (credit card) payment details via the App. For processing the products taken from the Fridge the customer is pre-authorized before the Fridge opens and will be charged when the Fridge is closed (payment settlement). The order information (what products are taken of the Fridge) is registered by using RFID technology.

To put it simply, consumers pay us for the products from our Fridge.
