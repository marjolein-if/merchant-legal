We, Frischepost, are running a pilot project with commercial fridges ("Fridges") containing fresh and healthy food, drinks, snacks and other products supplied by us ("Products"). The technological solutions used in the Fridges make it possible for us to record and process which Products you purchase from us. This makes it easier for us to stock the Fridges properly and to know our consumersâ€™ needs. Payments occur through our Frischepost Fridges App ("App"), a mobile app that you have to install on a mobile device, or through a payment terminal ("Payment Terminal") that is built onto the Fridges.
